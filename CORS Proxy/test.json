                    "Text": "<p>Over the years, the phrase “neighborhood schools” has become a predictable mantra in Denver school board elections.</p>\n<p>Candidates across the political and ideological spectrum regularly voice their support for the concept, and no wonder. Who doesn’t like the idea of children attending schools close to and preferably within walking distance of where they live?</p>\n<p>So here’s a jarring question: What if neighborhood schools in a largely segregated city are, in fact, a lousy idea? What if their very existence does as much as any other single factor to contribute to inequities and achievement gaps in our public schools? What if doing away with neighborhood schools would improve the odds for low-income kids of color?</p>\n<p>Would elected officials, parents, educators back away from them?</p>\n<p>Probably not. But those are questions that frame the debate against neighborhood schools.</p>\n<p>“The neighborhood school is a good deal for children whose parents can afford to live in good neighborhoods, but it's a terrible way to allocate educational opportunities,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior Fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and author of several books on education equity issues.</p>\n<p>Researcher David Rusk summed it up nicely in his 2003 study, “Denver Divided.” “Where a child lives largely shapes the nature of the child’s educational opportunities – not in terms of how much money is spent but who are the child’s classmates.”</p>\n<p>And, Rusk adds, “knowing the percentage of low-income pupils (in a school), one can predict a school’s percentage scoring proficient or advanced on (state standardized) tests and fall within 10 percentage points of the actual percentage about 95 percent of the time.”</p>\n<p>Even more succinctly, Rusk stated: “Housing policy <em>is </em>school policy<em>.”</em></p>\n<p>In other words, making neighborhood schools the top priority in a racially and socio-economically segregated city all but consigns low-income kids of color to an education inferior to what their more affluent peers get in wealthier parts of town.</p>\n<p>A recent study by the advocacy group A+ Denver puts this in stark perspective. Only 8 percent of Denver’s Hispanic students and 5 percent of its black students attend DPS’ 31 majority-white schools. Most of those schools are affluent as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 49 percent of the district’s white students attend majority-white schools, even though white students comprise just 22 percent of the district’s students.</p>\n<p>And here’s the kicker: 94 percent of the majority-white schools earned Denver’s top two school performance ratings. The other 6 percent are too new to have ratings.</p>\n<p>Conversely, A+ found, 70 percent of Hispanic students and 52 percent of black students attend concentrated non-white schools, where between 90 and 100 percent of students are minority.</p>\n<p>Tellingly, among those 104 schools, just 36 percent earned blue or green, the district’s highest two ratings. Nearly two-thirds ranked as either below par, on the road to failure, or flat-out failing.</p>\n<p>Another recent study conducted by the Center for Reinventing Public Education shows that non-poor families and white families use DPS’ SchoolChoice system to find the best match for their children at “far higher rates” than low-income, minority families.</p>\n<p>Combine the findings of these two studies, and the conclusion is clear: Affluent white families find ways to attend schools where there are a lot of affluent white kids. Often, that’s in wealthy neighborhood schools.</p>\n<p>Conversely, low-income black and Hispanic families tend to stay put in sub-par neighborhood schools in poor parts of town, mostly in southwest, northwest, and far northeast neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>It’s not that low-income families don’t want the best for their children. But they face obstacles to exercising choice that more affluent families hurdle with ease. Transportation is one major factor; the fact that low-income parents often work multiple jobs and have limited time to seek out choices is another. Language can be an additional obstacle for some families.</p>\n<p>Helping to ameliorate these challenges, some charter schools aimed at educating low-income kids have set up shop in the most challenged neighborhoods. Despite the rapid growth of networks like STRIVE Prep and DSST, however, the schools cannot always keep up with demand from families who want to send their kids there. And some families prefer a more traditional educational model.</p>\n<p><strong>“A tool for segregation”</strong></p>\n<p>Tom Boasberg is the first DPS superintendent in recent memory who has made school integration one of his top priorities. He acknowledges that focusing disproportionately on neighborhood schools is problematic from an equity perspective.</p>\n<p>“The simple point is that there are multiple values at play and when we let one value (like neighborhood schools) trump all others we get into trouble,” Boasberg said in a recent interview.</p>\n<p>Because the city remains largely segregated, housing patterns “will override all your efforts to integrate schools if geography is your only value. And that’s not OK.”</p>\n<p>Too often, Boasberg said, neighborhood schools are used as “a tool for segregation.” It’s understandable, he said that people want to attend schools with people “they’ve grown up with and with whom they have a lot in common.” However, he said, when that results in racially and socio-economically segregated schools, it undermines efforts to foster equity.</p>\n<p>Laura Lefkowits served on the Denver school board in the mid-1990s, when the federal court order mandating busing for integration lifted and DPS decided to return to a system of neighborhood schools. She supported that shift at the time, but now, with the benefit off 20 years’ hindsight, sees it as a major mistake.</p>\n<p>Almost every argument in favor of neighborhood schools has a stronger counter-argument, Lefkowits said. For example, she said, “people argue that neighborhood schools promote a sense of community, that they in fact become the center of the community. But that’s not a reason to keep them in place” when they create such inequities, she said.</p>\n<p>“People find community in other ways that aren’t as geographically based, like churches, book groups, health clubs,” she said.</p>\n<p>The reflexive support for neighborhood schools reeks of nostalgia, Lefkowits said. “It harkens back to a time that no longer matches the reality of Denver today,” she said.</p>\n<p>But shifting political rhetoric away from neighborhood schools will be difficult, Lefkowits said. “It appeals to the middle class, who pay attention to school board races and vote in big numbers, and whom the district wants to attract back into its schools.”</p>\n<p><strong>Some</strong><strong> possible solutions</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.tcf.org/assets/downloads/Kahlenberg_ANewEraofCivilRights.pdf\">a study released in September</a>, Kahlenberg of The Century Foundation advocated for alternatives to neighborhood schools and better fair housing policies as a way to foster education equity. Not all of Kahlenberg’s remedies are fully applicable in Colorado, because a state law mandating open enrollment allows parents to choose, within loose limits, where to send their children, both within and among school districts.</p>\n<p>Among Kahlenberg’s suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote socioeconomic school integration policies for traditional public schools, including: Magnet schools using attractive programs to draw a diverse set of students to a school, and providing transportation; inter-district choice between city and suburban districts, and “controlled choice” programs, in which districts assign students to schools to promote socioeconomic diversity.</li>\n<li>Approve charter schools that overtly promote socioeconomic integration, as does the DSST Public Schools charter network in Denver.</li>\n<li>Strengthen inclusionary zoning policies, which require developers to set aside units in new developments throughout the city that are affordable to low- and middle-income residents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lefkowits has her own proposal, more tailored to Denver. The school board should adopt a policy, she said, barring the district from “taking any new schools into its portfolio,” whether charter or district-run, if the student body deviates by 15 percentage points from the district’s overall percentage of low-income students. Currently, 70 percent of DPS students qualify for subsidized school lunches, a proxy for poverty.</p>\n<p>While it would be logistically impossible to bring all existing schools into this kind of balance, requiring new schools to be more integrated is feasible, Lefkowits said. And as Denver grows and gentrifies, creating mixed-income schools should become a less daunting task, if the district continues to view this as a top priority.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, DPS has made efforts to foster integration by creating enrollment zones. Under enrollment zones, students are assigned to one of several schools within broader boundaries than those surrounding traditional neighborhood schools. Families can list their preferred school but aren’t guaranteed a spot in that school.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind enrollment zones, Boasberg has said, is that the broader an enrollment area’s boundaries, the more diverse the population living within it.</p>\n<p>DPS has focused most of its enrollment zone attention on secondary schools, though more recently DPS created the Stapleton neighborhood elementary zone and one in the far southeast section of the city. Lefkowits said the district would have a major fight on its hands if it tried to expand the elementary enrollment zones across the city.</p>\n<p>“That’s far less palatable to the public than converting failing neighborhood elementary schools to high-performing charters,” she said.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood schools won’t be disappearing from Denver anytime soon, if ever. But having an open conversations about their merits and flaws would be a good start, advocates and educators say. And, Boasberg said, such discussions would reveal people’s hidden fears and biases.</p>\n<p>“It’s vitally important that we begin to have these hard conversations about race, income and equity,” he said.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>This story is part of Rocky Mountain PBS’ ongoing project coverage, Race in Colorado. </em><a href=\"http://www.rmpbs.org/thegap/\"><em><u>Standing in the Gap</u></em></a><em> examines race in public education in the state.

This month’s new report from the research group assesses just how those interim guidelines are faring.</p>\n<p>Not so well, it turns out.</p>\n<p>The math is simple.</p>\n<p>Lake Mead, backed up by iconic Hoover Dam just outside Las Vegas, receives about 9-million acre-feet of water annually from Lake Powell, a small percentage of which also comes from downstream tributaries. But after sending water to Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico, after evaporation and other subtractions, Lake Mead loses 10.2 million acre-feet each year.</p>\n<p>During the ongoing 15-year period of drought in the river basin, the annual shortfall of 1.2 million acre-feet of water in Lake Mead has come to be known as the “structural deficit.” Everyone who has seen the ring-around-the-tub photos of Lake Mead in recent years knows what that means. Each year the deficit drops the surface level of Mead by 12 feet, according to the research group.</p>\n<p>If the surface falls to 1,075 feet above sea level as measured on Jan. 1 of any year, the interim guidelines state that the secretary of the interior can declare a shortage on the river. And the lake briefly dropped below that level this past June, before record-breaking spring precipitation in the Rockies boosted it back.</p>\n<p>Should a shortage be declared, water deliveries could be curtailed – with the size of the delivery reduction depending on just how far the lake level falls. Should Mead’s surface reach 1,025 feet, for example, deliveries of consumptive water to Arizona, Nevada and California would be curtailed by 500,000 acre feet.</p>\n<p>“It’s worth noting that 500,000 acre feet is not even half of the structural deficit,” said Doug Kenney, director of the Western Water Policy Program at the University of Colorado, and a member of the research group. “It’s not enough to stop the problem.”</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_13876\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/06/1landsat_lake_mead_may04_30m.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13876 size-medium\" src=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/06/1landsat_lake_mead_may04_30m-336x226.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Mead's water level has dropped 135 feet since 2000. \" width=\"336\" height=\"226\" /></a> Lake Mead's water level has dropped 135 feet since 2000.[/caption]</p>\n<p>In other words, even with the prescribed curtailment in deliveries, if the structural deficit remains the same, the lake level would continue to plummet.</p>\n<p>“At 1,000 feet, the interim agreement calls for a ‘re-consult,’” Kenney said.</p>\n<p>That would be an interesting meeting, because at an elevation of 1,000 feet, or thereabouts, Lake Mead would hit “dead pool” status, meaning that Hoover Dam could no longer generate electricity or deliver water to Las Vegas (the city is currently engaged in a massive construction project to place pipes closer to the bottom of the lake).</p>\n<p>“The parties (to the interim guidelines) hoped that a shortage declaration would not actually be needed,” the research group report observes, “and only provided for reductions up to 500,000 acre feet. (But) as evidence grows of a warming-induced, long-term reduction in basin water supplies, the likelihood of shortages greater than 500,000 acre-feet increases.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the latest national climate assessment states that the nation’s hottest and driest region, the Southwest, will only become more so in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>To say that there are immense legal and political challenges in dealing with water shortage issues on the river is to understate. Since the original pact between the seven states in 1922, there have been countless lawsuits, treaties, acts of Congress and Supreme Court decisions. And now it looks like the interim guidelines may not cut it.</p>\n<p>The Colorado River Research Group’s new report calls first and foremost for enacting strategies to deal with the structural deficit in Lake Mead.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way to solve the overall issues of the river without resolving the structural deficit,” Kinney said in an interview with Rocky Mountain PBS News. “This particular aspect is primarily a lower basin issue. But the faster the structural deficit pulls down Lake Mead, the more pressure, political pressure and legal pressure, will be on the upper basin.”</p>\n<p>The research group proposes numerous tacks for diminishing the deficit, including developing alternative supply sources such as desalination, reducing existing losses – including ways to account for unavoidable losses such as reservoir evaporation in consumptive use decisions – conservation, voluntarily purchasing and retiring some water rights, and ensuring “continued flows from the upper basin at adequate levels.”</p>\n<p>Arizona, for example, has proposed subtracting evaporation losses at Mead, about 600,000 acre-feet annually, on a proportionate basis from the consumptive allotments of the three lower basin states. Each state would get less, but that could cut the deficit in half.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the research group said, all of this “requires a redefinition of normal – one that is based on a realistic, and likely changing, basin water budget.”</p>\n<p>The reality of drought in the last 15 years could become the new normal, Kinney said.</p>\n<p>“Any little increment in warming has a huge impact on the basin,” he said. “A little more surface evaporation and evapotranspiration by plants make a huge difference. Those are huge users of water and are temperature dependent. During the drought, precipitation is down 4 percent, but stream flows are down 19 percent. It messes up every phase of the hydrological cycle.”</p>\n<p>The new normal could look different.</p>\n<p>The math is simple.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>In addition to the <a href=\"http://www.coloradoriverresearchgroup.org/\">new report</a> from the Colorado River Research Group, the U.S. Department of the Interior has published a new interactive info-graphic dealing with drought on the Colorado River.

That's right, it's the holidays and everywhere you look homes and businesses are decorated with electrical cheer. But how much electricity do these decorations use, and how much are they costing us?</p>\n<p>An American home fully festooned with (incandescent) lights and moving decorations might spend an extra $58.34 on their energy bill this month. We arrived at that number by looking at five popular decorations and how much electricity they use over the holiday season.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-lit tree</strong><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1278\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/12/510237559_3353ff8ce4_o-140x140.jpg\" alt=\"510237559_3353ff8ce4_o\" width=\"217\" height=\"216\" /></p>\n<p>The tree is the centerpiece of holiday decorations in most homes. While in the old days we used to spend hours wrapping those lights around it, now you can skip that step and buy a pre-lit tree. Just plug it in and let the holiday cheer begin. A 7.5 foot tall tree comes equipped with 650 incandescent mini-bulbs. At an average of 0.45 watts per bulb, that's a total of 292.5 watts — or roughly 0.29 kilowatts — that the pre-lit tree uses at any time.</p>\n<p>Let's say you turn on your tree in the evening and leave it on overnight, so it's on for an average of 12 hours every day throughout the month of December. That's 372 hours, which brings us to a grand total of about 109 kWh (the unit you’ll see on your energy bill) of energy used by the pre-lit tree during the holiday season.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span><a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a\">According to the EIA</a>, the average price of residential electricity in Colorado is 12.72 cents per kW hour. In total, the energy to power the pre-lit tree during the month of December will end up costing you just under $14.00.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1279\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/12/2110690740_e9474f4cd1_o-140x140.jpg\" alt=\"2110690740_e9474f4cd1_o\" width=\"213\" height=\"213\" /><strong>Outdoor lights</strong></p>\n<p>Let's assume that you use a modest amount of lights to decorate the outside of your house — about 10 strands of energy-efficient LED lights, which would use only about 48 watts. Assuming you also turn those on for 12 hours every day during the month of December, you'd use a total of about 18 kWh of energy, which would cost $2.27. LED lights use a lot less energy than other holiday bulbs, so they're also the cheapest to power throughout the holidays — but you pay a premium for them at the store, so it’s good to know the incandescent comparison, too. On average, the same modest display using incandescent bulbs would use a total of 151 kWh of electricity, and would cost $19.31 for the full season.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1280\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/12/3050706229_10c8e2b216_o-140x140.jpg\" alt=\"3050706229_10c8e2b216_o\" width=\"216\" height=\"216\" /><strong>Moving reindeer</strong></p>\n<p>That adorable reindeer on the lawn might look like it's grazing on your grass, but it’s really eating electricity. There's no point in plugging the reindeer in when the sun is shining, so let's say you light it up at the same time as your tree and lights. A 60-inch reindeer with 250 incandescent lights would use about 42 kWh of energy during the holiday season, which adds up to $5.32 extra in electricity consumption on your energy bill.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1281\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/12/305271551_d771007076_o-140x140.jpg\" alt=\"305271551_d771007076_o\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" /><strong>Inflatable snowglobe</strong></p>\n<p>Inflatable lawn decorations are probably the most expensive, not only to purchase but also for the amount of electricity they use. A large, animated snow globe can use about<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span><a href=\"http://energyboomer.typepad.com/energyboomer/2008/11/energy-cost-of-christmas-decorations.html\">200 watts</a> at any time. These are visible day and night, so let's assume you leave it plugged in for 24 hours a day during the entire month of December. That would be a total of 149 kWh, which would add almost $19 to your energy bill.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1282\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/12/6891430727_a30e1752b4_o-140x140.jpg\" alt=\"6891430727_a30e1752b4_o\" width=\"231\" height=\"231\" /><strong>Electric train</strong></p>\n<p>Some expensive and elaborate<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span><a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Polar-Express-Electric-Christmas-Train-Set-631960X/202327563\">electric trains<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></a>use a CW-80 Transformer, which uses 80 watts at any time. You probably don't want to leave the train on all day, so let's say it’s in its “loco” motion for 3 hours a day during the month of December. It would end up using a total of 7.4 kWh, which would cost you just about $1 on your energy bill.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the grand total of $58.34 that could be added to your usual power bill this month.

But Weld County's population is expected to double to half-a-million, and the growth will not be just along the Front Range.</p>\n<p>A <i>Rocky Mountain PBS News</i> analysis of data from the state demographer and the U.S. Census Bureau shows seven of the 10 fastest growing counties will be on the Western Slope, including Eagle, Garfield and Routt counties.</p>\n<p>The numbers show an estimated 7.8 million people will call Colorado home by 2040, an increase of about 2.3 million. All that growth will take a toll on the state's infrastructure as well as water and other natural resources.</p>\n<p>The population projections from the state demographer also show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost half of the state’s growth, 1.1 million people, will talk place in the seven county Denver metro area, whose population will soar to 4.1 million by 2040. Denver will remain the second largest county, barely edging out Arapahoe County. Both will have more than 850,000 residents within 25 years.</li>\n<li>Douglas County, the state’s growth leader in the 1990s and early part of the 21st Century will see growth slow.  By 2040, it will rank only 24th in overall growth since 2015 with its population increasing by 51 percent.</li>\n<li>San Juan County will remain the state’s smallest county, adding only 82 residents and have a total population of 787 by 2040. Otero and Washington counties on the Eastern Plains will grow the least, adding just over 5 percent to their respective populations over the next 25 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"Colorado continues to attract those in the 24-35 year age group and that means there's jobs here and young people are coming from all over the country to fill those jobs,\" said Mark Radke, with the Colorado Municipal League.  \"It shows health, if you were seeing the opposite you'd know you'd have a problem.\"</p>\n<p>Growth, though, poses its own challenges.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_14422\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/colorado-population-projections_2010-2040_state-demography-office_11302015.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-14422 size-full\" src=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/colorado-population-projections_2010-2040_state-demography-office_11302015.png\" alt=\"colorado-population-projections_2010-2040_state-demography-office_11302015\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></a> State Demography Office / Department of Local Affairs[/caption]</p>\n<p><b>Affordable Housing</b></p>\n<p>Colorado's housing market is <a href=\"http://www.kunc.org/post/colorados-fast-recovery-brings-growth-and-housing-crunch\">already tight</a>. More people will likely continue to price out those who can't keep up with the real estate market.</p>\n<p>Spokeswoman Kelly Moye of the Colorado Association of Realtors said some in the industry are concerned that the absence of housing affordability will become a major issue.</p>\n<p>\"So eventually our market will become not affordable for most people,\" Moye said. \"And when companies look to bring jobs and all their employees here, they may choose another place because it's not an affordable place to live ... so it's a big challenge.\"</p>\n<p>It's already a challenge in Colorado's <a href=\"http://www.kunc.org/post/summit-county-middle-class-feels-squeeze-attainable-housing\">resort communities</a>. Thirty-year-old Tran Pham was able to find a place to live in Telluride, but that's just half the equation. She couldn't find space to grow her Vietnamese food business, so she's <a href=\"https://pixpix.co/gnartgnart/8Hi3VNNZhW/\">moving on</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I love Telluride. (But) my passion to do something for myself is a little bit bigger than Telluride,\" Pham said. \"If I was able to get a place set up here then I would totally be staying.\"</p>\n<p><b>An Urban-Rural Divide</b></p>\n<p>Most of those moving here will likely settle in more urban areas, while some <a href=\"http://www.kunc.org/post/colorados-rapid-urban-growth-encroaching-weld-countys-ag-roots\">rural communities</a> are struggling to stay relevant. Pockets of Western Colorado and the Eastern Plains will stay stagnant or lose population.</p>\n<p>John Sutherland, the city administrator of Lamar – located two hours east of Pueblo – said young people in his community are leaving to go to areas with better job prospects.</p>\n<p>\"We've got a number of initiatives underway by people who have dug their heels in and said we're not going to allow this to happen,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Sutherland is hopeful that \"attitude will win,\" but he isn't sure it will be enough. For the Municipal League’s Radke, taking on the challenges seen in Lamar and elsewhere will take some new approaches.</p>\n<p>\"What I've always found heartening is the inventiveness of these communities and building on what they have and making the most of that to improve their economy,\" said Radke.</p>\n<p><b>Planning For What's Next</b></p>\n<p>Change is inevitable – which is why state leaders say it's important to create long-term plans now. For example, how do we ensure enough water for those additional 2.3 million people the state expects by 2040? With an acre foot of water for every two families annually, the growth will require almost 300,000 acre feet of new water each year. By comparison, Lake Dillon, the largest reservoir in the Denver Water system, has a capacity of 257,304 acre feet.</p>\n<p>Gov. John Hickenlooper is promising action on that front in the newly-released statewide water plan. Colorado also has a commission on aging and during the 2015 session lawmakers created a separate task force to study the issue and examine everything from healthcare and transportation to housing and retirement savings.</p>\n<p>While Colorado is among the youngest states in the country, a large group of people who moved here in the 1970s will be reaching retirement. State demographer Elizabeth Garner points out that nothing \"magical happens at 65,\" but that change is part of the deal.</p>\n<p>\"You start switching into that non-worker, your commuting is different, your use of transportation is different, your housing may change,\" Garner said. \"Your spending changes.\"</p>\n<p>Managing that change is the next challenge for a growing Colorado.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_14420\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"525\"]<a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/Lake-Dillon.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-14420 size-full\" src=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/Lake-Dillon.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Dillon is the largest reservoir in the Denver Water system, at 257,304 acre feet.

In the meantime, they're trying to start a pet photography business. [/caption]</p>\n<p>As an eighth grader at northwest Denver’s Centennial ECE-8 school a few years back, Evelyn Gomez demonstrated more of an affinity for career-focused learning than academics, a fact that was not lost on her teachers.</p>\n<p>So when it came time to choose a high school, they steered her toward CEC Early College, a 40-year-old career and technical education school housed in a fortress-like building a stone’s throw from downtown Denver.</p>\n<p>Gomez, now a 16-year-old high school junior, took to the program immediately. Since matriculating at CEC (which originally stood for Career Education Center), she has discovered a passion for entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>Gomez’s best friend, Dominique Maes, 16, graduated from Skinner Middle School and followed her older brother to CEC Early College. Initially she wanted to pursue CEC’s renowned culinary track, where she would be able to work in the kitchen and dining room of the school’s restaurant, the Elliot Street Cafe, which is open to the public for inexpensive lunch on weekdays.</p>\n<p>But like, Gomez, she quickly found herself drawn to business, marketing and entrepreneurship, and her interest in the restaurant business faded.</p>\n<p>“I like how much control you get in the field of entrepreneurship,” said Maes, who speaks in enthusiastic bursts. “You love what you’re doing because it’s creating something. You have so much control over yourself, what you do.”</p>\n<p>The same could be said for the 21 other career-track programs offered at CEC, ranging from welding to sports medicine, from computerized auto mechanics to computer programming, from fashion design to construction trades.</p>\n<p>It’s precisely that focused, self-motivating approach that makes the school a notable success when compared to other Denver high schools serving large numbers of low-income, minority students.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about students having aspirations,” said Scott Springer, the school’s veteran principal. “Academically they might not be stronger than students elsewhere, but they are more motivated, and that’s huge.”</p>\n<p>There are about 430 full-time students in grades 9-12 at CEC, and another 320 who bus to CEC from other Denver high schools every afternoon to take career-focused classes not offered at their home schools.</p>\n<p>And ‘early college’ is more than a moniker. Students who stay at CEC for a fifth year can earn an Associate’s Degree through the Community College of Denver, at no cost to themselves. All CEC seniors and some juniors spend every morning at the Aurora Higher Education Campus downtown, taking classes at CCD.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago the conventional wisdom in secondary education was that all students should graduate from high school and attend a four-year college, the holy grail of post-secondary life. Anything short of that was seen as akin to failure.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_14412\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/CEC-school-2.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14412\" src=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/12/CEC-school-2-336x448.jpeg\" alt=\"There are many career paths at CEC Early College.

Here two students in a fire science class enact coming to the aid of a fallen comrade.[/caption]</p>\n<p>More recently, the definition of a successful post-high school life has changed a bit. While providing all students with an education that prepares them for the option of four-year college is still an almost universal goal, paths that might not end at a bachelor’s degree are now widely viewed as viable and worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, jobs that pay a living wage are available to students who earn an associate’s degree or a technical certificate. And pursuing those alternate paths does not close the door on students who eventually decide they want to pursue a four-year degree. It just gets them working for decent money sooner.</p>\n<p>During that college or bust era, CEC Early College churned along, much as it has since the mid-1970s, providing a diverse student body with a cornucopia of career-oriented education and training options.</p>\n<p>Today, CEC (which once stood for Career Education Center) produces about 100 high school graduates each year. Almost no one drops out and almost everyone graduates with a technical certificate or with enough college credits to send them well on their way toward an associate’s degree.</p>\n<p><strong>An array of options</strong></p>\n<p>Maes and Gomez are putting their business management training to good use. They are working to raise capital to start Paws Photography, a pet photography business. They applied for but didn’t get a $500 junior achievement grant, so they’re turning to a crowdsourcing Internet site to raise start-up funding. They figure just a few hundred bucks will get them a green screen, camera, and printer, which is all they need to get going.</p>\n<p>“This place makes you step outside your comfort zone,” Gomez said of CEC.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the only option the two girls are pursuing. Both plan to pursue Certified Nursing Assistant credentials, which would qualify them to work in hospitals and nursing homes. They hope to land nursing internships during their senior year while they take classes to prepare them for the Certified Nursing Assistant exam.</p>\n<p>Maes said she sees that as just a preliminary step to attending medical school and become a neurological surgeon.</p>\n<p>Gomez and Maes led a recent visitor through the school’s long, windowless hallways, where evidence of hands-on learning was everywhere. A group of students in a criminology class spoken into walkie-talkies as they investigated a mock hold-up.</p>\n<p>\"Someone is robbing culinary, right? Over,” one girl barked into her radio.</p>\n<p>In an alcove near the main office, several students dressed in full firefighting regalia attended to a student playing at being overcome by smoke. Down the hall, in a video lab, Kevin Olives, a 15-year-old sophomore, used Final Cut Pro software to put the finishing touches to a music video about boyfriend-girlfriend domestic violence.</p>\n<p>Students are focused and driven, and teachers respond to that enthusiasm, students said.</p>\n<p>“I feel a closer connection with all my teachers here than I ever did at other schools,” Maes said.</p>\n<p>“The teachers seem more engaged here and care about our success. They go that extra mile,” Gomez said.</p>\n<p>Springer, CEC’s principal, has spent 11 years at the school in two stints, interrupted for years by a central office job that he couldn’t wait to leave to get back into the school. An unflappable sort, Springer’s sense of calm seems to pervade the school.</p>\n<p>“In my 11 years, I haven’t seen one single real fight here,” he said on a warm November morning.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t take credit for that, attributing the calm to the kind of student the school attracts. “They tend to be more introverted and reserved,” he said. “A lot for them would get lost in a bigger high school.”</p>\n<p><strong>A record of success</strong></p>\n<p>Students like Maes and Gomez are typical of CEC, in both their passion for pursuing careers and their enthusiasm about the school. School-wide data reflect the strong culture of connection between students and their course of study.</p>\n<p>CEC falls just short of receiving DPS’ highest School Performance Framework rating, blue, or distinguished. It hits that highest mark in most subcategories: student achievement, post-secondary readiness, enrollment, and student and parent engagement and satisfaction. Academic growth measures fall within the second highest (green, or “meets expectations”) category.</p>\n<p>The school does this with a student body that looks a like those at other, much lower-performing Denver high schools. Fully 86 percent of CEC students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, a proxy for poverty. That same percentage of students is Hispanic, while 6.5 percent are white, 3.2 percent black and 2.8 percent Asian.</p>\n<p>Nearby North High School has similar student demographics to CEC but notably lower achievement. North has made major academic strides in the last few years, yet still ranks as a yellow school, “accredited on watch.” It does not hit blue on any measures, and green, or “meets expectations” on two: student growth over time and parent satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>The early college experience</strong></p>\n<p>CEC staff pushes students to decide before the end of sophomore year whether they want to pursue a technical certificate or an associate’s degree. Those decisions aren’t final, but set students on a path. A significant number of students who choose the certificate route end up attending college, Springer said.</p>\n<p>Among the school’s 2014 graduates, 69 percent enrolled in a two- or four-year college, most of those two-year. Many of the remaining 31 percent stayed at CEC for a fifth year to attain an associate’s degree. “Only five to 10 kids didn’t go on” to some sort of higher education, Springer said.</p>\n<p>CEC students are carefully prepared for the college experience before they set foot on the Auraria campus. They’re coached on how to behave, study habits, and on not clumping together in ways would make them conspicuous.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big change at first, being with college kids,” Maes said. “Immature (high school) kids have to stop what they’re doing and get with the program.”</p>\n<p>Gomez said the environment can be intimidating initially. But she said she likes the fact that “no one knows you’re a high school student.”</p>\n<p>That’s a deliberate strategy, Springer said. And CEC kids have proved over time that they’re up to doing college-level work. Last year, 92 percent of CEC kids earned a passing grade in their college classes, compared to 74 percent of full-time CCD students.</p>\n<p>“We will put four to six kids in an English class,” Springer said. “We tell them don’t sit together, and don’t tell the professor you’re a high school student. Then, at the end of the semester, when you get your A or B, go up, shake the professor’s hand and say, ‘by the way, I’m a high school student at CEC early College.’</p>\n<p>“Our kids knock it out of the park.”</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>This story is part of Rocky Mountain PBS’ ongoing project coverage, Race in Colorado. </em><a href=\"http://www.rmpbs.org/thegap/\"><em>Standing in the Gap</em></a><em> examines race in public education in the state.

Yesterday's post examined the largest districts outside metro Denver.</p>\n<p><b>Metro area:</b></p>\n<p><b>Denver Public Schools:</b> The Denver school district in the past 10 years had the second highest gains in reading proficiency for its Latino students among the 20 districts and the second highest gains in reading proficiency for its black students among the five districts with significant black student populations. Proficiency levels for Latino students rose from 28 percent proficient to 41 percent while black student achievement in reading rose from 38 percent to 46 percent. However, the gaps with white students increased during the decade because white proficiency rates rose even faster. As a result, the district had the highest gaps for both Latino and black students, 42 and 40 percentage points respectively. The Latino proficiency level was the third lowest among the 20 districts and the black proficiency level was the second lowest among the five districts.</p>\n<p>The same trend emerged for math proficiency. The district had the highest gains in proficiency levels for both Latino and black students over the past 10 years. But it also had the largest gaps between both groups and white students.</p>\n<p>Low-income  student proficiency scores increased the most over the past 10 years among the 20 districts, gaining 16 percentage points in reading. But the gap widened with white students and was the largest among the 20 districts last year at 36 percentage points.</p>\n<p><b>Aurora Public School District:</b> The Aurora school district ranked in the middle of the largest 20 districts in terms of gains in Latino reading proficiency scores over the past 10 years. The percent scoring proficient rose 8 percentage points and the gap with white students fell almost 7 percentage points to 27 percentage points – 41 percent vs. 68 percent. Still that was the sixth widest gap among the 20 districts. And its 40.6 percent overall proficiency level for Latino students was the lowest among the 20 districts.  The percent of black students proficient or better rose 3 percentage points in the past 10 years, the second lowest gain among the five districts with significant black enrollment. The gap with white students only narrowed by one percentage point to 26 percentage points – 43 percent proficient vs. 68 percent.  The overall black proficiency score of 43 percent was the lowest among the five districts.</p>\n<p>The district fared slightly better in math proficiency. Both Latino and black students saw proficiency levels rise by 8 percentage points over the past 10 years, narrowing both gaps by less than two percentage points. The Latino gap with white students was 22 percentage points – 32 percent vs. 54 percent– and the black gap was 26 percentage points – 29 percent vs. 54 percent, placing Aurora in the middle of comparable districts. As in reading, the Latino proficiency score of 32 percent was the second lowest of the 20 districts and the black proficiency score of 28.5 percent was the lowest of the five school districts with significant black student populations last year.</p>\n<p>Aurora had the lowest reading proficiency scores for its low income students among the 20 districts – only 41 percent scored proficient or better last year. The gap with non-low income students was 23 percentage points, the 8th lowest among the 20 districts. It narrowed the gap by 2.5 percentage points over the past 10 years. It increased overall reading proficiency levels for low-income students by 5 percentage points during the same time.</p>\n<p><b>Cherry Creek School District:</b> The Cherry Creek district has made consistent gains in achievement for its black and Latino students and has closed the gaps with its white students.</p>\n<p>In reading, the percent of Latino students scoring proficient rose 10.5 percentage points to 62 percent over the past 10 years. That is the third highest percent for Latinos among the 20 districts. The percent of black students scoring proficient increased almost 5 percentage points to 58 percent, the third highest among the five districts with significant black enrollment.</p>\n<p>As a result, the gaps with white students narrowed. For Latino students, the gap fell more than 9 percentage points to 21 percentage points during the past 10 years. That was the third largest drop in gaps among the 20 districts and ranks in the middle in size of the gap. For black students, the gap fell 3.5 percentage point to 25 percentage points. That is 4th highest gap among the five districts.</p>\n<p>In math, the percent of Latino students scoring proficient rose by 11 percentage points to 51 percent over the past 10 years. That was the fourth biggest increase in proficiency among the 20 districts and the third highest overall proficiency percent.  The percent of black students scoring proficient rose six percentage points to 41 percent proficient. The gain was the third highest among the five districts and the overall proficiency percent was the second highest.</p>\n<p>Cherry Creek lowered the gap in math between Latino and white students by more than six percentage points over the decade and the gap between black and white students by about one percentage point. However, both gaps remained among the widest among the large school districts.</p>\n<p>The district lowered its reading proficiency gap between low income and other students by 7 percentage points over the past decade, the sixth best improvement among the 20 districts. It now stands at 27 percentage points – 57 percent proficient vs. 84 percent proficient. The percent of low income students scoring proficient increased almost 10 percentage points over the past 10 years, the 8th highest increase among the 20 districts. The 57 percent reading proficiency is the seventh highest level for low income students among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Brighton School District:</b> The Brighton school district had the fifth highest improvement in Latino reading proficiency scores over the past 10 years among the 20 largest school districts, rising by 11 percentage points. The gap between Latino and white students fell by more than six percentage points to about 19 percentage points during that time – 56 percent vs. 75 percent proficient, ranking in the middle of the 20 districts. Last year’s gap was the 7th lowest among the 20 districts.  As a result, about 52 percent of Latino students were proficient or better in reading last year, also ranking in the middle.</p>\n<p>The district did not fare as well in math proficiency scores for Latino students. Overall proficiency levels rose about 7 percentage points and the gap narrowed by only 2 percentage points over the past 10 years. That dropped the gap to 41 percent vs. 60 percent. That was the 7th narrowest gap among the 20 districts.  Overall, 40.5 percent of Latino students were proficient in math, ranking the district in the middle of the pack.</p>\n<p>At 21 percentage points, the district last year had the fifth lowest gap between low income and other students among the 20 districts – 53 percent proficient in reading vs. 74 percent.  Low income student proficiency levels rose more than 12 percentage points over the past 10 years, the fifth highest gain among the 20 districts. But the gap between low income and other students only fell by 4 percentage points, one of the smallest gains among the 20 districts. The 53 percent reading proficiency score was only the 13th highest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Littleton Public Schools:</b> The Littleton district had the second highest reading proficiency scores, 66 percent proficient or better, for Latino students last year among the 20 largest school districts.  Proficiency scores rose almost 10 percentage points over the past decade and the gap with white students fell by seven percentage points to about 20 percentage points – 66 percent vs. 86 percent, the 9th narrowest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The school district made similar gains in Latino math proficiency scores, raising them by more than 10 percentage points to 50.5 percent proficient, the fourth highest scores among the 20 districts. However, that only dropped the gap with white students by less than a percentage point – 51 percent vs. 75 percent proficient, the 7th highest gap among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The district posted the second highest proficiency levels for low income students last year – 62 percent proficient in reading. It also increased low income student proficiency by 10 percentage points over  the past 10 years, the sixth highest gain among the 20 districts. The gap between low income and other students fell by 7 percentage points to 25 percentage points – 62 percent vs. 87 percent, ranking in the middle.</p>\n<p><b>Adams 12 Five Star Schools:  </b>The Five Star school district saw the percent of Latino students scoring proficient in reading rise 4 percentage points over the past 10 years. That was the fifth lowest improvement among the top 20 school districts.  As a result, it was one of only three school districts to see the gap between Latino and white students widen during the past 10 years. It increased a percentage point to 27 percentage points – 48 percent to 75 percent proficient. Only six of the 20 districts had wider gaps.</p>\n<p>The district fared better in math proficiency among Latino students. The percent scoring proficient or better rose more than 7 percentage points to 38 percent and the gap narrowed by about five percentage points to 26.5 percent. Still, the gap was the 6th highest among the 20 districts and the overall percent scoring proficient was among the lowest.</p>\n<p>The district was one of four out of the 20 districts to see the gap increase slightly between low income and other students over the decade – a 0.2 percentage point increase to 29 percentage points. That gap – 46 percent vs. 75 percent – was the 6th highest among the 20 districts. Overall proficiency scores rose by six percentage points over the decade, one of the smallest increases. And the 46 percent proficiency score in reading for low income students was the fifth lowest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Westminster School District:</b> Latino reading proficiency increased by 4.5 percentage points in the past 10 years, one of the lowest gains among the 20 largest school districts. Overall 41.5 percent of Latino students were proficient in reading, the second lowest rate among the 20 districts. The gap between Latino and white  students fell 6.5 percentage points in reading, ranking in the middle of the 20 districts and now stands at 20 percentage points – 42 percent vs. 62 percent proficient, also ranking in the middle of the districts.</p>\n<p>The district fared better in math proficiency gaps.  The gap dropped about four percentage points in the past 10 years. The difference between Latino and white proficiency rates is now 15 percentage points – 31 percent vs. 46 percent proficient, the third lowest gap among the 20 districts. However, the district has the lowest overall math scores among the 20 districts for Latino students with only 31 percent scoring proficient.</p>\n<p>The district had the second biggest narrowing of the gap between low income and other students – 10 percentage points. The resulting gap of 15 percentage points in reading was the lowest among the 20 districts. However, the overall score of 43 percent of low income students scoring proficient was the second lowest among the 20 districts. Part of the narrowing of the gap was caused by a drop in proficiency scores for non-low income students.</p>\n<p><b>Douglas County School District: </b>The Douglas County School District has among the highest reading achievement scores for Latino students and among the lowest gaps with white students on proficiency levels. The district’s Latino students were 64.5 percent proficient in reading last year, the third highest rate among the largest 20 districts. The gap with white students was about 18 percentage points – 65 percent vs. 83 percent proficient, the sixth smallest. However, the district's progress in raising proficiency scores or closing the gap over the past 10 years has been flat. Latino proficiency percentages actually dropped less than half a percentage point and the gap narrowed by only a percentage point.</p>\n<p>The district posted improvements with math proficiency scores. Over the last decade, levels rose about five percentage points to 52 percent of Latinos scoring proficient. That was the second highest percent among the 20 districts. The gap with white students fell three percentage points and now stands at 21 percentage points, the 8th lowest gap among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The district was one of only 4 out of the 20 districts to see the gap between low income and others students in reading proficiency grow over the past 10 years –  by just under 1 percentage point to 56 percent vs. 83 percent proficient.  The gap last year was the 7th highest among the 20 districts. The 56 percent proficiency level for low income students ranked 10th among the 20 districts. Part of the reason for the increase in the gap was the school district’s absorption of a low income, online school, Hope.</p>\n<p><b>Jefferson County Public Schools:</b> Over the past 10 years, the Jefferson County district has increased Latino reading achievement scores by more than 9 percentage points to 60 percent proficient. That is the sixth highest percent among the top 20 districts. During the same time, the district reduced the gap with white students by six percentage points to about 23 percentage points. That is the 9th widest gap among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>Math proficiency has not risen as much or the gaps narrowed as much in the Jefferson County district. The percent of Latino students scoring proficient has risen by almost 7 percentage points to 43 percent. That is the 7th highest rate among the districts. But the gap with white students only narrowed by less than half a percentage point over the last 10 years and now stands at 27 percentage points. That is fifth widest gap among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The district last year had a gap of 26 percentage points in reading proficiency levels between its low income and other students – 58 percent proficiency vs. 85 percent. That was the 10 highest gap among the 20 school districts. However, the gap fell by 4½ percentage points as proficiency levels for low income students increased by about 9 percentage points. The nine point gain was the 9th highest among the 20 districts.  The overall proficiency score of 58 percent was the fifth highest for low income students among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>To read the broad story covering the 20 largest districts please click <a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/2015/12/03/drive-to-level-academic-inequities-in-biggest-districts-is-work-in-progress/\">here</a>.

The <a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/2015/12/03/drive-to-level-academic-inequities-in-biggest-districts-is-work-in-progress/\">analysis by Burt Hubbard </a>of Rocky Mountain PBS News is based on standardized test scores last year and 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>Today's report examines the large districts outside metro Denver.</p>\n<p><b>Boulder Valley School District:</b>  Boulder Valley has made the second largest gains in the percent of Latino students scoring proficient or better in reading, gaining 12 percentage points in 10 years. Last year,  51 percent of Latino students were proficient. As a result, the district made the biggest inroads in the gaps between Latino and white students, cutting them by 11 percentage points – 51 percent proficient vs. 87 percent. However, Boulder still had the second highest gap last year, 36 percentage points. It ranks 6th among the 20 districts for Latino gains in math proficiency. However, the gaps in math were also the second largest among the 20 districts, 38 percentage points.</p>\n<p>The school district had the biggest gap last year in reading proficiency between its low income and non-low income students as defined by eligibility for free and reduced priced lunches, 37 percentage points – 51 percent proficient for low income students vs. 88 percent proficient for others. However, the district ranked third among the 20 districts in narrowing the gap by more than 7 percentage points.</p>\n<p><b>St. Vrain School District:</b> The school district made progress in raising achievement among its Latino students and closing the gaps between its Latino and white students in standardized testing. It ranked 6th among the 20 school districts in terms of the biggest jumps in Latino reading proficiency levels, rising almost 11 percentage points over the last decade to 50 percent proficient. As a result, it narrowed the gap by almost 8 percentage points in the past decade, ranking 5th among the 20 districts. However, it still had the 3rd largest gaps in proficiency levels, more than 30 percentage points. In math, the district also raised Latino proficiency levels over the past decade by 7 percentage points. But the gap between Latino and white students actually widened over the past 10 years and is the third largest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The school district had the third highest gap between its low income and non-low income students in reading proficiency last year, but narrowed the gap by more than six percentage points over the past 10 years, ranking 6th among the 20 districts. About 54 percent of its low-income students scored proficient last year vs. 85 percent of its non-low income students.</p>\n<p><b>Poudre School District:</b> The school district ranks in the bottom half of the largest 20 school districts, both in terms of increasing Latino reading proficiency levels over the past decade and closing the achievement gap with white students. The percent of Latino students scoring proficiency or better last year rose just over 5 percentage points since 2005 and the gap closed by almost 5 percentage points. The gap is almost 30 percentage points – 56 percent vs. 85 percent proficient – and the 5th highest among the 20 districts. Latino students in the district did slightly better in math achievement. Proficiency levels rose by almost 10 percentage points over the past 10 years, ranking in the top half among the 20 districts, but the gap only closed by a little over 2 percentage points and at more than 30 percentage points – 44 percent vs. 74 percent proficient – was the 4th highest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>Poudre had the 8th widest gap among the 20 districts in reading proficiency between its low income and non-low income students. About 60 percent of its low income students were proficient vs. 88 percent of non-poor students. However, the 60 percent proficiency was the fourth highest level among low income students in the 20 districts. The district closed the gap by more than 5 percentage points over the past 10 years, ranking in the middle among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Thompson School District:</b> The school districts ranks in the bottom half of the 20 largest school districts in increasing Latino student reading proficiency levels. They rose about 5 percentage points over the past 10 years. It ranked in the middle in terms of closing the gaps with white students, narrowing them by almost 7 percentage points. The gap remains high, almost 24 percentage points – 53 percent proficient vs. 77 percent. That also ranks the district in the bottom half. In math, Latino student proficiency rose about 4 percentage points over the past 10 years, one of the lowest gains among the 20 districts. The gap dropped by about one and half percentage points over the past decade and remains high at almost 25 percentage points – 38 percent vs 62 percent. That is the 8th biggest gap among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The Thompson district had a 25 percentage point gap in reading proficiency levels between its poor and non-poor students with 56 percent of low-income students scoring proficient compared with 81 percent for other students. The gap was narrowed by only about three percentage points over the last 10 years, the sixth smallest gain among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Greeley-Evans School District:</b> The Greeley school district had the fourth lowest overall proficiency levels for its Latino students last year with only 46 percent achieving proficiency in reading. However, it posted the third largest increase over the past 10 years among the top 20 districts with composite Latino scores rising almost 14 percentage points. As a result, it narrowed the reading proficiency gap with white students by more than 8 percentage points, the 4th best improvement among the 20 districts.  Last year, 47 percent of Latino students were proficient vs. 75 percent for white students. The trends in math proficiency among Latino students were similar. Scores rose almost 14 percentage points over the decade, the third biggest jump among the 20 districts and the gap narrowed by three percentage points, ranking 5th among the 20 districts. Still, only 35 percent of the Latino students last year were proficient in math, the third lowest rate among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The district had the fifth highest gap between its low income and non-low income students last year, but ranked high in closing the gap over the past 10 years. The gap was 29 percentage points with 47 percent of poor students scoring proficient vs. 76 percent of the rest of the students. However, the district narrowed the gap by more than 6 percentage points, the sixth best improvement among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>The district also posted a 14 percentage point gain in reading proficiency over the past 10 years among its low income students, the fourth highest gain among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Mesa Valley School District:</b> The Mesa school district ranks 3rd among the 20 largest school districts in closing the reading proficiency gap over the past decade between Latino and white students. The gap has shrunk by eight percentage points as the percent of Latino students testing proficient has risen by eight percentage points to almost 57 percent since 2005 compared to 73 percent for white students. That is the 8th highest proficiency level for Latino students among the 20 districts.  Mesa has seen comparable gains in math scores with proficiency levels rising by 9 percentage points over the decade and the gap closing by more than 5 percentage points, ranking second among the 20 districts.  It now has the 4th smallest gap in math and reading among the 20 districts – 42 percent vs. 58 percent.</p>\n<p>The school district had the 4th smallest gap between low income and non-low income students last year among the 20 districts, slightly over 20 percentage points. Fifty-eight percent of is low income students were proficient in reading compared with 78 percent of the other students. The 58 percent was the sixth highest level among the 20 districts. Over the past 10 years, the district had narrowed the gap by four percentage points, ranking in the middle among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Colorado Springs School District:</b> The Colorado Springs school district saw reading achievement levels increase by three percentage points over the past decade among its black students and more than 7 percentage points among Latino students, closing the gaps by three and seven percentage points, respectively. Last year, 55 percent of Latinos and 52 percent of black students scored proficient in reading vs. 75 percent of white students. That ranked the district in the middle of the 20 largest districts for Latino gains over the decade, but only 4th out of the five districts with significant black student enrollment. Black and Latino students made comparable gains in math proficiency since 2005, gaining less than a percentage point and seven percentage points, respectively. The Latino-white gap in 2014 – 41 percent vs. 62 percent – dropped by about two percentage points. But the black-white gap – 31 percent vs. 62 percent – rose by more than three percentage points. The district ranked in the middle of the 20 districts for overall Latino proficiency scores and in the middle of the five districts for overall black proficiency scores.</p>\n<p>The district had a 22 percentage point gap – 57 percent vs. 79 percent proficient – in reading last year between its low income and non-low income students, ranking in the middle of the 20 districts. Low income proficiency scores rose 2½ percentage points over the past decade and the gap with non-low income students fell by six percentage points, also ranking the district in the middle. The 57 percent proficiency scores was the seventh highest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Harrison School District: </b>The Harrison school district had among the smallest gaps and highest proficiency scores for black and Latino students among the 20 largest school districts in Colorado.</p>\n<p>In reading, the district posted the largest gains over the past 10 years in percent of Latino and black students scoring proficient and advanced. Latino students gained 16 percentage points to 61 percent proficient, while black students gained 14 percentage points to 61 percent proficient. The Latino scores were the fifth highest among the 20 districts and the black scores were the highest among the five districts with significant black enrollment.  The districts also had the second lowest gap between white and Latino students – 12 percentage points – and the lowest gap between white and black students among the five districts, 12 percentage points</p>\n<p>The district posted similar gains in math proficiency among Latino students and to a lesser degree among black students. The district saw Latino scores rise 14 percentage points to 50 percent proficient and black scores rise 11 percentage points to 42 percent proficient.  The Latino gains were the second highest among the 20 districts and the black gains were the highest among the five districts.</p>\n<p>The white-Latino gap of 14 percentage points was the second lowest among the 20 districts but it actually grew by 1 percentage point over the past 10 years. The black gap was larger, 22 percentage points, and was 4 percentage points higher than 10 years ago. Still it was the lowest gap among the five districts. In terms of overall scores, the district ranked 4th for Latino scores and 1st for black scores.</p>\n<p>At 16 percentage points, Harrison had the third narrowest gap in reading scores between its low income and non-low income students – 61 percent proficient vs. 77 percent – among the 20 districts. It closed the gap by 3 1/2 percentage points, ranking in the middle of the 20 districts. It improved low income student proficiency by 14 percentage points, the second largest increase by the districts. And its 61 percent proficiency levels for low income students was the third highest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Falcon School District:</b> The Falcon School District’s performance by its low income and black and Latino students was significantly impacted by the 2013 consolidation of  GOAL Academy, an online program for mostly low income and minority students. As a result, the district had one of the largest gaps between low income and other students last year among the 20 districts and a large increase in the gap of 14 percentage points over the past decade.</p>\n<p>The district had a similar decline in reading proficiency levels for Latino students and an increase in the gap between white and Latino students over the past 10 years. However, last year, it had the second lowest gap in reading proficiency between white and Latino students – 14 percentage points. Last year, 61 percent of Latino students scored proficient as did 75 percent of white students. The 61 percent was the sixth highest level among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p><b>Academy School District:</b> Academy, one of the wealthiest districts, had the highest Latino proficiency levels in reading with 78 percent of Latino students scoring proficient or better. The increase over the past decade was only 2 percentage points, one of the smallest gains among the top 20 districts, but the gap with white students, at about 8 percentage points, was the lowest among the 20 districts last year – 78 percent proficiency for Latino students vs. 86 percent for white students. The district also had the lowest gap and highest scores for Latino students in math proficiency. Last year, 60 percent of Latino students were proficient or better compared to 72 percent of white students.</p>\n<p>The district had the highest proficiency levels last year for its low income students with 69 percent proficient or better and the third smallest gaps with its non-low income students – about 18 percentage points. It increased low income proficiency in reading by 5 percentage points over the past decade and narrowed the gap by four percentage points.</p>\n<p><b>Pueblo City School District:</b> The Pueblo City district was one of only three districts among the top 20 to post declines in reading proficiency for Latino students with a 1 percentage point drop to 55 proficient last year. That ranked 9th lowest level among the 20 districts. The gap between Latino and white students over the past decade narrowed by less than 1 percentage point to almost 18 percentage points – 55 percent vs. 73 percent. That was the 5th smallest gap among the 20 districts. Latino students fared worse in math with proficiency levels dropping by more than seven percentage points to 36 percent proficient or better. That was the fifth lowest level among the 20 districts. However, the gap – 36 percent vs. 53 percent proficient – remained low, almost 17 percentage points, ranking 5th among the 20 districts. The 36 percent proficiency level was the fifth lowest among the 20 districts in math.</p>\n<p>Pueblo was one of only five of the top districts to see its gap in reading between low income and other students rise, increasing by about 2 percentage points to 22 percentage points – 54 percent vs. 76 percent proficient. Low income proficient scores in reading dropped by 2 percentage points over the past 10 years, one of only three districts to post lower scores. Its 54 percent reading proficiency for low income students was the 9th lowest among the 20 districts and its 22 percentage point gap was the 6th lowest among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>[table id=14 /]</p>\n<p>[table id=15 /]</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>Tomorrow's post will look the school districts in the metro Denver area that are among the 20 largest school districts in the state.

Progress hasn’t been uniform across the 20 districts, all located up and down the Front Range with the exception of Mesa Valley in Grand Junction, but each can point to strides made.</p>\n<p>In Greeley, dismal high school graduation rates for Latinos shot up after the district dramatically increased the number of students enrolled in more rigorous Advanced Placement courses.</p>\n<p>The Cherry Creek School District, on the verge of becoming a majority minority system, increased black and Latino enrollment in Advanced Placement classes and in gifted and talented programs, and launched nationwide searches for teachers of color. The result: Achievement gaps fell, high school graduation rates rose and more black and Latino graduates enrolled in college.</p>\n<p>In Denver Public Schools, reading and math proficiency are rising among low-income and black and Latino students through a process of integrating schools in mostly segregated neighborhoods. Teachers and staff are receiving awareness training about biases that may hinder learning.</p>\n<p>Even as progress can be demonstrated, however, profound disparities remain. Specifically, the analysis of the state’s top 20 districts by student population found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In most of the districts, only about half or less of poor, Latino and black students are achieving proficiency in reading, and only between 30 to 40 percent are in math. For white students, it is between 75 and 90 percent in reading and 60-70 percent in math.</li>\n<li>The gaps show up prominently in educational attainment. Only 70 percent of black students and 55 percent of Latino students graduate from high schools in the 20 districts combined. For white students, the rate is 85 percent. Half of black high school graduates enroll in college, while four in 10 Latino graduates do. More than six of 10 white grads enter college.</li>\n<li>Ninety percent of the teachers in the 20 districts combined are white, but almost half of the students are black or Latino.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“These gaps are the result of decades if not centuries of inequities in this country based on race and based on income and they will take time to close,” said Tom Boasberg, superintendent of Denver Public Schools.</p>\n<p>Most school districts have made incremental progress in narrowing the gaps, the analysis found.  Seventeen of the 20 school districts narrowed the gaps in reading proficiency between white and Latino students over the past decade, as have four of the five districts with significant black student enrollment.</p>\n<p>But that’s not good enough, said Aswad Allen, assistant dean of Diversity and Inclusion at the University of Colorado Denver’s School of Education and Human Development. Many Colorado school districts need to do a better job of teaching an increasingly diverse student body, he said.</p>\n<p>“The kids are the casualties in all of this. The entire system has to take a close look at how teachers can be better prepared to meet the students where they are with all of their diverse backgrounds.”</p>\n<p>There are additional inequities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rate of white student enrollment in gifted and talented programs is about three times higher than the black and Latino rates in the 20 districts.</li>\n<li>School districts have reduced the number of students suspended or expelled from school over the past decade. However, racial discrepancies persist.  In the 2013-14 school year, one out of every seven black students, one of every eight Latino students and only one of every 25 white students were suspended, expelled or faced other discipline among the 20 districts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>School districts began realizing the seriousness of the gaps about a decade ago when test scores showed big differences among socio-economic groups, said Greeley-Evans Superintendent Deirdre Pilch.</p>\n<p>“It was screaming at us that we had big work to do,” Pilch said. “And it was our responsibility to do it.”</p>\n<p>Several districts have stood out in their efforts to close the gaps by changing the way they approach teaching.</p>\n<p>The Harrison School District, serving some of the poorest neighborhoods in Colorado Springs, is among the best of the 20 districts in narrowing the differences by race and income in academic achievement. In the district of 11,000 students, 46 percent are Latino, 26 percent are white and 16 percent are black. About 70 percent of all students are low income.</p>\n<p>Last year, the district had narrowed the reading proficiency gaps between white students and black and Latino students to 12 percentage points. That was the lowest gap among the five districts with significant black student enrollment, and the second lowest among the 20 largest districts for Latino students.</p>\n<p>By comparison, more than half of the 20 districts had Latino-white reading proficiency gaps of 20 to 40 percentage points.</p>\n<p>The district has revamped curriculum, focused on different ways students with different economic and racial backgrounds learn, and eliminated barriers to enrollment in Advanced Placement classes, Harrison Superintendent Andre Spencer said.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, I 100 percent believe that if a student is taught, the student will learn and the student will perform,” Spencer said. “If we aren’t providing the student the opportunity to be taught, they can’t learn and they can’t perform.”</p>\n<p>The Harrison high school graduation rate has jumped from 67 percent to 78 percent in the past five years. For the 2013-2014 school year, there was little difference in the rate for white, Latino and black students. The percent of Latino graduates enrolling in college tripled during the same period.</p>\n<p>The Cherry Creek School District in parts of Aurora and Arapahoe County does not shy away from issues raised by racial differences and biases, Superintendent Harry Bull Jr. said.</p>\n<p>“When you lean in and listen, what you discover is that children have very different experiences as they interact with schools,” Bull said. “A lot of those experiences are predicated on race. You can’t ignore that. You can’t suggest that white culture, this is the norm. We’re saying that every child should have the opportunity to experience a challenging and rigorous curriculum.”</p>\n<p>Unlike Denver and other low income, minority school districts, Cherry Creek’s neighborhoods tend to be integrated racially, leading to integrated neighborhood schools. The district only has one charter school.</p>\n<p>But the district also has aggressively changed policies and approaches to adjust to its changing demographics, Bull said. The percent of minority students enrolled in gifted and talented programs is on the rise, with results including rising proficiency levels on standardized tests and smaller gaps with white students.</p>\n<p>“It’s at a pace that I wish were faster,” Bull said. “I think the work is done when you’re not talking about a gap.”</p>\n<p>Denver with its often segregated neighborhoods is seeing some success in raising achievement in reading and math in schools integrated by school board policy or by gentrification.</p>\n<p>Overall, DPS, where 70 percent of students are low income and almost 60 percent are Latino, is the most segregated among the 20 districts. While Denver schools have registered some of the largest gains in proficiency among all students, white student proficiency in reading and math has risen faster. The net result: Denver maintains the biggest gaps among the 20 districts and some of the widest in the nation.</p>\n<p>One of Denver’s strategies is more integration. It has expanded enrollment zones in northwest and northeast Denver to encompass both Latino, black and white neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Its most successful charter schools, the eight Denver schools of Science and Technology, are intentionally integrated both economically and racially through lotteries.</p>\n<p>“Study after study has shown that all kids benefit when classrooms are integrated, that all kids learn,” said Boasberg, the superintendent.</p>\n<p>Ten years ago, the Boulder Valley School District had the widest achievement gaps between its white and Latino students in the state – almost 50 percentage points in reading and 44 percentage points in math.</p>\n<p>It still has wide gaps, but it made the most progress in narrowing the reading gap of all 20 districts, dropping it by 12 percentage points over the past 10 years. Latino reading proficiency rose from 39 percent to 51 percent. Setting aside money to put in pre-schools into low-income elementary schools was a key to the success, said Chris Barge, director of the Boulder Community Foundation’s School Readiness Initiative.</p>\n<p>In the Greeley-Evans school district, high school graduation rates five years ago for Latinos hovered just over 50 percent compared to about 75 percent for white students. Last year, almost 75 percent of the district’s Latino students graduated from high school and the gap with white student had narrowed to 10 percentage points. That was the biggest gain in Latino graduation rates among the 20 districts.</p>\n<p>One of the keys was dramatically increasing the percent of Latino high school students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses over the past 10 years, Greeley Superintendent Pilch said.</p>\n<p>“We removed all of the barriers,” said Pilch, who became superintendent this past summer after working in the Boulder district.</p>\n<p>It helped that the Greeley community rallied around efforts to hike graduation rates, she said.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to impact our entire community over and over again if we don’t graduate kids. That’s the reality here,” Pilch said.</p>\n<p>Success stories abound, but replication of academic achievement on a large scale among low income and minority students remains elusive, said CU-Denver’s Allen</p>\n<p>“We always have the story of the kid who comes from the deprived background who excels and does well, “ Allen said. “That story is a beautiful story, but I think the question is how do we have whole scale change that impacts the lives of a whole generation.”</p>\n<p>[table id=14 /]</p>\n<p>[table id=15 /]</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><i>This is part of Rocky Mountain PBS News’ ongoing project coverage, Race in Colorado. </i><a href=\"http://www.rmpbs.org/thegap/\"><i>Standing in the Gap</i></a><i> examines race in public education in the state.

(Kristofor Husted/Harvest Public Media)[/caption]</p>\n<p>The rural areas in the U.S. where immigrant workers that pick crops like cotton and melons find work often lack the social services and affordable housing vital to integrating new arrivals into a community. That means many farmworker families end up in dilapidated buildings, which can come with health risks.</p>\n<p>Angel Castro’s old road is muddy and covered with flooded potholes. He lived here during the 1990s just behind a large John Deere store in Kennett, Mo.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the trailer parks that rent to migrant people,” he says. “It’s not in the greatest shape, you know? But if you need a place to stay you have to do what you have to do.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of trailers and campers sit on lots littered with plastic bottles and food wrappers. Large tires hold down roofs, siding is falling off the mobile homes and cracked windows are covered up with plastic. Castro says during growing season, these trailers pack in up to ten farmworkers.</p>\n<p>“Right here, I think they charge you by the head,” he says. “It depends on how many people are staying in the trailer. I think it’s like $120 a month a person.”</p>\n<p>Castro was born in Mexico but raised just across the border in Texas. His family spent summers chasing the watermelon crop from state to state as migrant farmworkers. Now, he has a job recruiting farmworkers’ kids to enroll in school programs.</p>\n<p>“When we used to travel, we ran into some of those trailers, too,” Castro says. “My sister used to cry, ‘Oh look at the places we live in.’ And my dad would say, ‘It’s only a month. Just ride it out a month and we’ll be out of here.’”</p>\n<p>Almost three-quarters of hired crop farmworkers don’t actually travel the country following the harvest, according to Department of Agriculture <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/background.aspx\">data</a>. Rather than short-term migrants looking for seasonal work, many farmworkers are remaining in the U.S. longer and looking for a place to settle.</p>\n<p><strong>Housing options, funding limited</strong></p>\n<p>Generally there are three types of housing options for farmworkers: private housing like the trailers Castro lived in, employee housing provided by a landowner, and government-funded housing.</p>\n<p>“There is a big need across the country,” said U.S. Rural Housing Administrator Tony Hernandez. “There is probably more need than money we have.”</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture lends money through a <a href=\"http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/farm-labor-housing-direct-loans-grants\">federal program</a> to build housing for farmworkers. Hernandez says it’s critical to provide housing for the people who help get Americans’ food to the table.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that long ago farmworker housing was nonexistent in a lot of places,” he said. “People lived in their car. There was not a bathroom for places to have. This is really an effort to make safe and decent housing and better working conditions and housing is a big part of that.“</p>\n<p>Hernandez says while federal loan programs have added to farmworker housing stock, there is stiff competition for loans and some projects don’t get funded immediately. The program is dependent on money allocated by Congress, which is in flux – from as much as $60 million to as little as $5 million in recent years.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, where there isn’t local housing available, farmworkers often end up in off-the-grid shantytowns.</p>\n<p><strong>Health concerns, lack of inspections</strong></p>\n<p>“Farmworkers don’t make a lot of money. They don’t have a lot of options. The housing that they are able to find is often substandard,” said Virginia Ruiz, director of occupational and environmental health at the advocacy group <a href=\"https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/about-farmworker-justice\">Farmworker Justice</a>.</p>\n<p>Farmworkers are often priced out of rural rental markets that lack the resources, infrastructure or desire to build affordable housing, Ruiz said, and many end up crammed into rundown trailer parks.</p>\n<p>“You also see often overcrowding which can also be harmful psychologically,” she said. “It’s very stressful. It’s easier in overcrowded housing for diseases to spread.”</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis, pesticide exposure and viral breakouts are a few of the more common threats facing farmworkers living in housing without adequate showers, ventilation and utilities. And these arrangements are common nationwide.</p>\n<p>“Practically every state has a lack of enforcement,” said Moises Loza, the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.ruralhome.org/hac-services\">Housing Assistance Council</a>, which works to improve housing conditions in rural areas.</p>\n<p>Enforcement of housing codes doesn’t happen often enough because of limited resources, Loza said. And you’re not going to hear the tenants raising a fuss about the conditions either.</p>\n<p>“They’re uninformed about what rights they might have or what codes there are in housing,” Loza said. “But even if they did know, they’re also afraid of getting immigration after them.”</p>\n<p>Seventy percent of U.S. farmworkers were born in Mexico and about half are undocumented, <a href=\"http://www.ruralhome.org/storage/documents/rpts_pubs/ts10-farmworkers.pdf\">according to the Housing Assistance Council</a>. Because immigration status complicates dealing with local authorities, Loza said the population is largely invisible.</p>\n<p><strong>‘You have to survive’</strong></p>\n<p>Angel Castro’s old trailer has been spiffed up and looks nicer than the ones rented to farmworkers in his old neighborhood. He said he was the first Mexican to move here. Now, he said, the trailer park is filling up with farmworkers from Central America without options.</p>\n<p>“When you don’t have the money or the means to get somewhere else or buy somewhere else, you do what you have to survive,” he said. “To live.”</p>\n<p>Castro now lives with his family 10 miles away in a town with a burgeoning Hispanic population. He says he was fortunate to work his way out of the crop picking trade and the trailer park. But he says without education or enforcement of housing codes, the living conditions for the tenants who continue to work the fields will linger.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>This story was reported by Harvest Public Media as part of a fellowship with the Institute for Justice and Journalism.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

The reservation is home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.</p>\n<p>Over time, the relationship between Shannon and the tribes grew. Next came an oral history project, then a film. Even though she didn’t come to talk about oil, the topic was unavoidable on the reservation. Rapid oil development brought lots questions with it, like what are the impacts on air, water and soil?</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_2574\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3108.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2574\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3108-771x578.jpg\" alt=\"Prairie Rose Seminole, an instructor at the local Boys and Girls Club, points out where Lake Sakakawea flooded Indian lands.\" width=\"355\"/></a> Prairie Rose Seminole, an instructor at the Boys and Girls Club on the Fort Berthold Reservation, points out where Lake Sakakawea flooded Indian lands. Jordan Wirfs-Brock/Inside Energy[/caption]</p>\n<p>The tribe had been searching for ways to answer these questions, and many others. Local researchers from the Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College were conducting their own air quality monitoring experiments, but it was just a start. So, when science teachers from the tribal college brought up the topic with Shannon, they collaborated on a way to deepen and extend the research by developing hands-on science kits for teachers and students to explore the impacts of the oil boom in their community. This idea came from the community, so they wanted to make sure that the community was involved all along the process.</p>\n<p>How? It developed into a four step project: First, the teams from Colorado and North Dakota holds listening workshops on the Fort Berthold Reservation to gather concerns and questions from teachers.  In step two, Colorado team members return home, compile what they've learned, and share it back with the teachers in North Dakota, who vote on their favorite ideas.</p>\n<p>In step three, Shannon and the Colorado team – which includes an environmental engineer, a citizen science specialist, and several students – will develop prototype teaching kits. Next May, they return to North Dakota so teachers can try them out. Finally, in step four, the Colorado team will modify the kits based on feedback from the teachers and make them ready for use in schools for the fall of 2016.</p>\n<p>In mid-October, everything was all set for step one. Shannon and her team had booked plane tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. Then, days before that first trip to North Dakota, Shannon’s research assistant got a message from their contacts at the tribal college. They’d changed the time, date and place of the North Dakota workshop. Instead of being upset about the change of plans, Shannon was, “through the roof excited. Because it meant that our community partners were taking ownership and control of the process.”</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_2575\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3037.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2575 size-medium\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3037-336x336.jpg\" alt=\"One of the listening workshops was held at Parshall High School, right as classes let out for the weekend.\" width=\"336\" height=\"336\" /></a> One of the listening workshops was held at Parshall High School, right as classes let out for the weekend. Jordan Wirfs-Brock/Inside Energy[/caption]</p>\n<p>Two of the listening workshops were held on a Friday at Parshall and White Shield High Schools on the reservation, right as school was getting out. And two were at Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College on Saturday, in a sunny second-floor room, with homemade chicken stew cooked by an instructor at the local Boys and Girls Club. Shannon and her team from Colorado weren’t sure anyone would show up, so when more than 30 local community members gathered, she was thrilled.</p>\n<p>Shannon wrote a question in magic marker on a flip-chart: <i>What questions would you like your students to investigate about potential human and environmental impacts of oil development here on the reservation?</i></p>\n<p>The teachers and community members asked questions about the psychological effects of light pollution, and the impacts of spills on the water and soil. They asked about natural gas flaring, and whether construction was driving away deer populations. They also talked about whether the portrayals of the Bakken in popular media are inaccurate, and what will happen when everyone leaves.</p>\n<p>And they had observations: Many students are below grade-level in reading and math. Teachers said they need ways to teach basic concepts that explain what’s happening with oil development, like how hydraulic fracturing works, and where the oil goes.</p>\n<p>The biggest surprise for Shannon and the team from Colorado was the wide range of teachers who attended the workshops. They taught subjects ranging from health to English to math, from first grade through college. “And we never would have known that if we didn’t go and listen first,” said Shannon.</p>\n<p>What might the science kits that come out of this process look like? They could have tools to take and analyze soil chemistry. Or activities to map the migration of animal populations. And they might be used in language arts classes instead of science classes, or be designed so younger kids can team up with older kids.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_2577\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3135.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2577 size-medium\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3135-336x252.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Shannon of the University of Colorado at Boulder demonstrates what a teaching kit might look like.

This one happens to be on fossils. Jordan Wirfs-Brock/Inside Energy[/caption]</p>\n<p>This project is evolving to meet the community’s needs. And that makes it radically different from other citizen science efforts. Conventional citizen science invites regular people to <a href=\"http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/\">search for alien life</a> or <a href=\"http://eyewire.org/explore\">map the brain</a>. Often, it starts with scientists working on a research project, and is driven by scientists who bring citizens along for the ride. But on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, this is “really citizen science for citizens,” said Shannon. “The teaching kits are a tangible product of our work together, but it's the process that's really important.”</p>\n<p>After the listening sessions, Prairie Rose Seminole, the Boys and Girls Club instructor who cooked the chicken stew, took the group from Colorado to see some spots where she forages for plants. As a pump jack plugged away a few hundred meters off, she pointed out sumpweed and buffalo berries, and explained how with the oil development and the spills that come with it, they’ve had the soil tested to make sure it’s contaminant free.</p>\n<p>She also took the group to a bluff overlooking Lake Sakakawea, which was formed when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River.</p>\n<p>“We're just now starting to talk about how to we heal ourselves from the flooding of our bottom lands. How do we deal with that loss and grief that came with it. Because we're passing that down,” Seminole said.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_2576\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"771\"]<a href=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3068.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2576 size-large\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/IMG_3068-771x578.jpg\" alt=\"The University of Colorado Team stands with Prairie Rose Seminole on a bluff overlooking Lake Sakakawea, observing native plants and the changing landscape.\" width=\"771\" height=\"578\" /></a> The University of Colorado Team stands with Prairie Rose Seminole on a bluff overlooking Lake Sakakawea, observing native plants and the changing landscape.

Jordan Wirfs-Brock/Inside Energy[/caption]</p>\n<p>For some, the oil boom evokes similar feelings as the dam. That emotional connection to the land here is why a project that encourages the community to take charge of its own information, its own research, its own learning, goes beyond the results of any single science experiment. It’s part of a bigger process.</p>\n<p>“We have to start healing that so our future generations can have that hope, that ownership of these lands,” Seminole said. “And how we can have that sense of ownership that we didn’t have before.”</p>\n<p>That means ownership of the science as well, in order to monitor what’s happening around them, but also to encourage kids here to become teachers, engineers, nurses – jobs that are often imported. Citizen science kits are a cool outcome of this process, but the real goal is helping kids learn to ask questions and investigate the answers themselves.</p>\n"

Enjoy:</p>\n<p>Despite the fact our turkey dinner konks us out, we all understand food is energy for our bodies, and that energy is actually the same energy that runs our cars, that heats our homes and that charges our phones.</p>\n<p>See, almost all of the energy on our planet is solar, or really, it’s nuclear. That sun energy beams down to the earth’s surface where it’s happily lapped up by plants, which can convert that energy.  That's something we animals cannot do, but we can eat the plants and steal their energy or eat the other animals that ate the plants and get it that way. It’s all the same energy, just moving around.</p>\n<p>This has been going on for hundreds of millions of years, back then, a lot of those plants, and some of the animals were covered up by sand and mud and rocks, and their sun energy was trapped before anybody else could get to it. Eons pass and those plants and animals changed into coal, oil and natural gas, which we discovered we can set on fire, and get that stored sun energy back.</p>\n<p>Today we use a lot of that fuel to grow the food we need to fuel ourselves. <a href=\"https://poweringag.org/node/104\" target=\"_blank\">In fact, 30-percent of our modern global energy use goes toward food production</a>, most of it coming from the stored sun energy in dead prehistoric plants and animals.</p>\n"

The Farm Service Agency is currently using an old Web-based system that duplicates what MIDAS was supposed to accomplish, according to government audits.</p>\n<p>Farm Service Agency representatives declined several requests for interviews and a tour of the system. USDA’s chief information officer, <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2015/06/0178.xml\">Jonathan Alboum</a>, did not return a request seeking comment.</p>\n<p>Also faulted by government reports were a dozen unnamed contractors hired to create MIDAS. SRA International, a large public company which <a href=\"https://www.sra.com/news/press-releases/sra-awarded-500-million-blanket-purchase-agreement-usda-sap-implementation\">won the initial $500 million MIDAS contract</a>, is based in Virginia and has an office in Kansas City. An SRA spokeswoman declined comment for this story.</p>\n<p>“Is the government at fault? Absolutely,” said <a href=\"http://appropriations.house.gov/_files/031711davidpownergao.pdf\">David Powner</a> of the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog that has done three reports on MIDAS. “Is there a responsibility on the part of lead and sub-contractors? Absolutely. Everyone’s in it together.”</p>\n<p><strong>A golden vision for MIDAS</strong></p>\n<p>When planning started in 2004 during the Bush Administration, MIDAS was heralded as a way for the government to efficiently pay out the billions annually to farmers who have signed up for government safety-net programs. Since the Farm Service Agency’s inception as part of Roosevelt’s New Deal (first known as the Farm Security Administration), government payouts have been made through the agency and its 2,200 county offices currently situated across the country.</p>\n<p>In June 2010, <a href=\"https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/midas_project_kickoff.pdf\">Vilsack announced at the MIDAS kickoff</a> in Washington D.C. that he hoped it would allow farmers to start trusting the government again by helping build “a more vibrant rural economy.” Officials said MIDAS would virtually link the Farm Service’s offices, place the 30-plus government farm programs in one system and eventually allow farmers and ranchers to access data from their home computer.</p>\n<p>Five years later, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z7U0o43MpQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Vilsack appeared before the House Ag Committee</a> sounding apologetic, quoting the Bible and admitting that “we didn’t measure our steps and we didn’t have as many counselors as we needed.”</p>\n<p>“When this thing was started in 2007-2008, I think the vision was pretty grand,” Vilsack said. “But I don’t think people fully appreciated the difficulty of basically implementing that in the context of a 1980 system, which is what we basically have at FSA offices.”</p>\n<p>Hurst, who was asked by congressional leaders to monitor the project and report back before the July hearing, said most farmers aren’t aware of MIDAS since it’s not operational yet. But he said he and others are frustrated by the antiquated system used by Farm Service and the <a href=\"http://www.rma.usda.gov/\">USDA’s Risk Management Agency</a>, another government program that handles crop insurance.</p>\n<p>Programs used by Farm Service (FSA) and the RMA aren’t compatible, he said. So Hurst ends up taking his crop information into the local FSA office, and then he walks it across the street to the RMA office.</p>\n<p>“I’m generating the same information three different times,” Hurst said. “I’m generating it to FSA, and then I’m taking it to an insurance agent in small-town Missouri who’s entering it by hand for RMA.</p>\n<p>“And all the time,” he said, “I’ve got a thumb drive with all that information already on it.”</p>\n<p><strong>History of problems dating to 2006</strong></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-657\">GAO audit published in 2008</a> warned of major problems with MIDAS, with the first issues popping up in 2006 and the USDA computer system shutting down entirely for a month in January 2007. The GAO found a lack of management, a failure to set performance goals and no dedicated staff to analyze the system.</p>\n<p>“The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has experienced significant problems with its information technology systems that support the delivery of benefits programs to farmers,” the 2008 GAO audit reported.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-586\">2011 GAO audit</a> triggered the attention of House Ag Committee Chairman Michael Conaway, R-Texas, who began an investigation in January, which confirmed previous audits.</p>\n<p>“FSA intended for the MIDAS program to modernize its delivery of programs to farmers and ranchers,” Conaway said during the July USDA oversight hearing. “Unfortunately, it’s been mismanaged as evidenced by the fact that its $140 million over budget and only contains two of the five planned core functions.”</p>\n<p>Two more reports done this year, one by the <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/03501-0001-12.pdf\">USDA’s Office of Inspector General</a>, found little progress, inadequate contractor oversight and an added annual cost of $50 million.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/670883.pdf\">2015 GAO report</a> went even further, finding that just 20 percent of the MIDAS program was functioning and questioning USDA’s ability to manage any IT program into the future.  By June 2013, Farm Service started developing similar applications to MIDAS on its centrally-located legacy system, called Web Farm, said the GAO’s Powner.</p>\n<p>“When that was done, you’re really duplicating effort,” Powner said. “I think a key question is: why wasn’t it halted sooner?”</p>\n<p>Vilsack told Congress that the USDA has made some progress with MIDAS and that the agency has seen some benefits. One benefit is offering farmers and ranchers who own land in several counties the ability to go to a single Farm Service office to view records, which wasn’t available in the past, Vilsack said.</p>\n<p>The USDA has established a review process, Vilsack added, and he sees weekly reports on department technology.</p>\n"

A native of the UK, he’s never actually had the pleasure of experiencing one. But as one of the world’s leading researchers on the carbon footprint of – well – everything (he even wrote a book subtitled “The Carbon Footprint of Everything”), he’s plenty familiar with the impacts of the foods that star in the traditional Thanksgiving Day spread.</p>\n<p>“Well, turkey is a meat. And most of the time, the thing to say about meats is that they’re quite an inefficient way of having nutrition,” says Berners-Lee. “But having said that, chickens and turkeys are very much at the efficient end of the meat spectrum.”<br />\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/234359307&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br />\nThat’s because a Thanksgiving turkey can go from egg to a bird that’s 20 pounds or more in just 14 weeks. So they’re not really on the planet long enough to make that big an impact. And it turns out it doesn't even matter all that much if you go with a local bird that only has to ship from the farmer down the road.</p>\n<p>“Well, it matters a bit. But it would still be fairly small compared to the actual footprint of growing the animal in the first place.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Berners-Lee says transportation might only account for 25 percent of your turkey’s total carbon footprint – assuming it’s not shipping by air. But bottom line, having a turkey on your Thanksgiving table is not all that bad. And the same goes for corn, potatoes, cranberries, pumpkins and a lot of the other foods that end up on your plate.</p>\n<p>“They’re seasonal vegetables. And they keep well,” says Berners-Lee. “And you don’t have to do anything crazy like put them on an airplane. So they’re fantastic. In fact, you probably can’t have lower carbon footprint food than potatoes and pumpkins.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/Berners-Lee-Thansgiving-Infographic.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2563\" src=\"http://1m5rjm4bgenp2600za110opvl3h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/Berners-Lee-Thansgiving-Infographic-771x890.png\" alt=\"Berners-Lee-Thansgiving-Infographic\" width=\"771\" height=\"890\" /></a><br />\nSo all in all, the Thanksgiving dinner looks pretty good from a carbon footprint standpoint. That is, if you go traditional.</p>\n<p>“This year is a little bit of a curveball,” says WESA reporter Margaret Krauss, who agreed to let us dissect the carbon footprint of her Thanksgiving plans. “But there is no turkey. There is a meat that will be grilled outside. Maybe we’re doing bratwurst, maybe we’re doing chicken, maybe we’re doing steak.”</p>\n<p>And the alternative menu could get Margaret into some carbon-footprint trouble according to Berners-Lee.</p>\n<p>“Yeah – red meats are quite a lot less efficient. The carbon footprint of beef would be about 24 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilo of beef. Whereas for turkey, it’d be nearer three.”</p>\n<p>And the air travel involved in Margaret’s Thanksgiving celebration – a flight from Pittsburgh to Salt Lake City – is a real killer.</p>\n<p>“So a Boeing 747 will get through a hundred and something tons of fuel per trip,” says Berners-Lee. “So you end up with an enormous carbon footprint shared out between the passengers. And your friend has to take a few tons of it on the chin.”</p>\n<p>Even worse, Berners-Lee says the fact that the fuel is burning higher up in the atmosphere doubles the climate impacts. So drive if you can. Better yet, take a train. But how does the carbon footprint of Thanksgiving travel stack up against the Thanksgiving meal? It’s not even really much of a comparison. Berners-Lee says for a 500-mile trip, you’d have to eat more than 100 pounds of turkey to match the impact of your travel.</p>\n<p>“That would be quite an achievement,” Berners-Lee says.</p>\n<p>As for the other major item on the Thanksgiving Day schedule – watching football – Berners-Lee says that’s a pretty guilt-free activity.</p>\n<p>“Everyone assumes the impact is going to be really high,” he says. “But watching TV turns out to be one of the lower-carbon leisure activities you can have – especially if a load of people all gather around the same TV set.\"</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p><em>This story comes to us courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.alleghenyfront.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Allegheny Front</a>, a news magazine on the environment in Pennsylvania.</em></p>\n"

(Mike Tobias for Harvest Public Media)[/caption]</p>\n<p>The population of monarch butterflies has declined so dramatically in recent years that the iconic insect is being <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/midwest/news/764.html\">considered for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s endangered species list</a>. In Nebraska and across the other areas of the Midwest, a stop on the monarch migration route, efforts are underway to determine the scope of the decline.</p>\n<p>Carrying notebook and camera, <a href=\"http://entomology.unl.edu/faculty/weissling.shtml\">Tom Weissling</a> wades through waist-high grass and plants at Nine Mile Prairie west of Lincoln, Neb. The associate professor in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Department of Entomology periodically stops, looks closely at plants and takes notes and pictures. It’s how he spent a lot of his summer, combing the state for signs of something that’s getting harder to find: monarch butterflies.</p>\n<p>“Mostly I’m trying to find Monarch larvae. Weissling said, walking through a field. “In my last trip I looked at several hundred plants and I only found about four larvae.”</p>\n<p><strong>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCbbu4c4ZA4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">CLICK HERE</a> to watch a video story on Weissling's survey)</strong></p>\n<p>Weissling is also looking for milkweed. The connection is important because monarchs lay their eggs exclusively on milkweed, and it’s the only thing the larvae will eat. Weissling’s rough survey took him to about two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties, and is something of a starting point in determining the decline of monarchs in the state.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.public.iastate.edu/%7Ejpleasan/GlyphosateuseandMonarchs\">Iowa State University report</a> estimated an 81 percent decline in the monarch population in the Midwest between 1999 and 2010, with a 58 percent decline in milkweed presence during the same time.</p>\n<p>“Less milkweed will equal fewer monarchs overall,” Weissling said. “I don’t think that’s something we want to experience.”</p>\n<p>The reasons behind the decline in monarchs can be controversial. Some say milkweed loss is<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/monarch_butterfly_decline_monsanto_s_roundup_is_killing_milkweed.html\"> caused by increased use of agricultural herbicides</a>. Others point to a <a href=\"http://blogs.columbian.com/fyi98642/2015/10/29/save-the-monarchs/\">loss of forestland in Mexico</a> where monarchs winter, and temperature fluctuations.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_14361\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"336\"]<a href=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/11/monarch-butterfly_630_600x450.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14361\" src=\"http://inewsnetwork.org/files/2015/11/monarch-butterfly_630_600x450-336x252.jpg\" alt=\"North American monarchs are the only butterflies that make a massive migration to California and Mexico each winter—up to 3,000 miles.

Big changes in ag production technologies.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, Hovorka said these are big changes that require a big response. Nebraska may develop a statewide conservation plan, Hovorka says, and strategies for increasing milkweed.</p>\n<p>“We think we can do that by planting seeds and live plants on public lands, parks and wildlife management areas, on some of the conservation lands that are owned by places like the Audubon Society and the Crane Trust and the Nature Conservancy,” Hovorka said. “We'd also like to see some different management along county and state roads. Right now we do a lot of mowing in places and at times we don't need to, and so that takes out the milkweed populations.”</p>\n<p>Weissling said they could also work on convincing businesses and homeowners to embrace milkweed as an addition to their landscaping, and just think differently about where milkweed could be allowed to grow.</p>\n<p>“My approach would be you don’t have to get rid of all of it,” Weissling said. “Maybe think of areas that are marginal for crops or areas that you don’t put in any crop production that maybe you could grow some milkweeds on.”</p>\n<p>It could take a lot of milkweed to reverse the trend. Hovorka said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is talking about a five-year goal of having a milkweed presence on 7 million acres nationally, primarily in the Great Plains. He said a million of those acres could be in Nebraska.</p>\n<p>“We're not talking about fields of milkweed,” Hovorka said. “There are some milkweed seed plots that are being planted that we need because we need a lot of seed in order to put that many plants out. But for the most part this is scattering milkweed across the landscape in school yards and in backyards. On ranches, on public lands.”</p>\n<p>Nebraska Game and Parks has already started doing some of this work.</p>\n<p>“We've got plans to do more but we've started planning milkweed production plots on more than two dozen of our wildlife management areas, and that will serve as a seed source to do more habitat work in the future,” said Scott Taylor, <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.ne.gov/\">Nebraska Game and Parks Commissio</a>n Wildlife Division administrator. “We've also started planning milkweeds across the state.”</p>\n<p>That includes working with partner organizations in September to plant 3000 milkweed seedlings along stretches of the Cowboy Trail, a Game and Parks recreational trail that runs from Norfolk to Valentine. The project was funded by a $150,000 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.</p>\n<p>\"Federally and regionally and within the state, there’s just a groundswell of interest right now in making sure monarchs are doing better than they appear to be doing the past few years,\" Taylor added.</p>\n<p>Bringing back monarch habitat, Hovorka says, is particularly important because it has a broader impact than the loss of butterflies.</p>\n<p>\"We have bees and other pollinators that are critically important to the ag economy and to growing some of the foods that we have,\" Hovorka said. \"So it's not just about losing monarch habitat. We're losing bees. We're losing the other pollinators. The monarch is sort of the big, flashy, bright species that people love. It's an easy thing to talk about. But what we really need to do around the landscape, while we’re restoring habitat for monarchs, we’re also restoring habitat for bees, for other pollinators, we’re diversifying the prairies that we have, and so that's good for a lot of different kinds of wildlife.\"</p>\n<p>Back at Nine Mile Prairie this summer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCbbu4c4ZA4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Weissling flipped over a milkweed leaf to expose a yellow and black striped monarch caterpillar</a>. He found 14 of these during his statewide summer survey, but said the statistics are more starting point than barometer at this stage. Just another part of an effort Weissling hopes will save what he calls the bald eagle of American insects.</p>\n<p><strong>Video Dispatch</strong></p>\n<p>Travel with Tom Weissling as he combs through fields searching for milkweed and monarch larvae.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCbbu4c4ZA4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br />\n></p>\n"
